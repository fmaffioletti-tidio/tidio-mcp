# Tidio MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with the Tidio customer service platform.  

It acts as a layer over the [Tidio OpenAPI (REST API)](https://developers.tidio.com/reference), making Tidio functionality available directly in LLM clients such as Claude Desktop.

## Requirements

- **Tidio Account** — Tidio Plus plan (or higher)  
- **API Credentials** — Client ID and Client Secret (see the [authorization guide](https://developers.tidio.com/docs/openapi-authorization))  
- **Environment** — Docker, or Python 3.13+ with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

## Setup

### Option 1: Non-Technical Users (Claude Desktop + Docker)

You can quickly get started using the ready-to-use Docker image `adrmrn/tidio-mcp` from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/adrmrn/tidio-mcp).

1. Install and run [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Install and open [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
3. In Claude Desktop, go to **Settings** → **Developer** → **Edit Config**, and open the `claude_desktop_config.json` file in a text editor
4. Add the following configuration, replacing the placeholders with your Tidio credentials:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "Tidio": {
         "command": "docker",
         "args": [
           "run", "-i", "--rm",
           "-e", "TIDIO_CLIENT_ID",
           "-e", "TIDIO_CLIENT_SECRET",
           "adrmrn/tidio-mcp:latest"
         ],
         "env": {
           "TIDIO_CLIENT_ID": "PASTE_YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE",
           "TIDIO_CLIENT_SECRET": "PASTE_YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop

### Option 2: Technical Users (Python)

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with `uv sync`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your Tidio credentials
4. Add the following configuration to your MCP client:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "Tidio": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "/absolute/path/tidio-mcp",
           "run",
           "server.py"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. Restart your MCP client to apply the configuration
